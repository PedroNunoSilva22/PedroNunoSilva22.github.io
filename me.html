				Multimedia Designer<br>
				
				<span2>Coimbra, Portugal</span2><br><br><br><br><br>

				<span>Who is Pedro ?</span>
				The date was 22nd March, 1993. The place was Coimbra. The number of copies, 2. Son of a merchant and an accountant. In the same day, a second copy of me was made, my twin brother.
				My best friend.<br><br>
				Since I have memory, I always liked to dedicate a special commitment to the artistic area that is imposed on us throughout our student life. Without, however, never discarding or devaluing the sciences since they are an indispensable basis for anyone. I love the act of knowing and learning a little about everything, especially if that comes from interacting with other people and	other cultures.<br>
				So, very soon I knew that the best way to combine those two passions are through the powerful world	of design. In so manny ways and supports it	can teach, promote, show singular perspectives and even make us think about our world like no other form of work. Better design make our lifes	easier, simplier and more appealing by providing us with new and better ways to see and do things, even the little daily tasks.
				Being able to use the design for this purpose is the main reason why I am a designer and I intend to be for the rest of my life.<br><br><br><span>@</span><br><br>
